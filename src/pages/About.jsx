                My journey into coding started a while back, and the more I learn, the more I realize how fascinating and dynamic web development can be. I've dabbled in everything from the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to the complexities of Node.js.

                This portfolio is a snapshot of my progress and the projects I've worked on. It's not about showcasing perfection; it's about sharing the journey of growth and improvement. I believe in the power of simplicity and functionality, and I strive to create websites that not only work well but also make sense to users.

                Away from the computer, you'll probably find me in a campus cafe, typing away at my laptop, or engrossed in a coding challenge. I'm not just chasing grades; I'm on a quest for knowledge and practical skills that can make a difference in the real world.
